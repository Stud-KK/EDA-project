# SparkSales: Illuminating Diwali Shopping Patterns

## Project Overview

This project, **SparkSales**, analyzes a company's Diwali sales data to extract actionable insights aimed at enhancing customer experience and boosting revenue. Utilizing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the analysis focuses on key parameters including gender, age, state, marital status, and product category.



## Dataset Information

The dataset comprises sales records during the Diwali festival period, including:

- **Customer Demographics**: Gender, Age, Marital Status, Occupation, State, Zone
- **Transaction Details**: Product ID, Product Category, Order Quantity, Sale Amount

*Note: The dataset has been pre-processed to remove null values and ensure data integrity.*

## Analysis Objectives

3. **Sales Trends**: Analyze sales patterns across different states and occupations.
4. **Gender-Based Analysis**: Examine purchasing behavior differences between genders.
5. **Occupation Impact**: Assess how occupation influences product preferences and spending.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed null values and duplicates to ensure data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. **Segmentation Analysis**: Grouped data by demographics and purchasing behavior.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Evaluated sales over time and across different regions.

## Key Findings
